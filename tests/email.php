Hi Ryan Gustafson,

When we tried charging your credit card this month for your subscription to ImportGenius.com, it was declined by your credit card provider. But don't worry! This is a simple fix.

Just sign in to your account and you’ll be prompted for the new card info.

Or if you prefer, just give me a call and I’ll take care of the issue for you in under a minute.

Thanks!
